# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Prerequisites
Before beginning, ensure you have installed:

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)

## Setting Up a Development Environment
- Install Dependencies
npm install

## Running the Development Server
npm run dev

The Vite development server will start, and the application should be able to viewed at http://localhost:5173
